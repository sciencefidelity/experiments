# Browser Notepad

A simple, lighweight browser based notepad for keeping notes on the fly. Inspired by [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io).

This is the solution to a problem I was having while studying Russian language. I wanted to take plain text notes in the browser in order to keep word lists and sentences to study. I found that Stackedit was doing what I wanted, but almost too well. When copying links into Stackedit the html is convered to markdown, but I wanted all metadata stripped.
