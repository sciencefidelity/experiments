# Character Counter

Simple script to count the number of characters entered into a textarea.

I've got an idea about being able to simply asses whether a column in a webiste is too wide or too narrow (50 to 75 characters is ideal). This might evolve into an app to test this with the added ability to change the font, font size and column width for a section of text in order to calcualte an ideal width/font size for a given situation.

### To do

- Count words and characters and characters without spaces
- Incorporate into the note notepad app
- Character count is not displayed on page refresh
