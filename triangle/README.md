# Rainbow Equalateral Triangle

Based on a collage I made ages ago, this is a css rainbow striped equalateral triangle.

### Ideas

- Animate the colours
- Change the colours with hover or touch
- Animate one colour at a time climbing the triangle while the other are transparent
- Make it responsive, based on percentages.
