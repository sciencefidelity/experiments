# Venn Diagram

This is a mathematically symetrical venn diagram made with css positioning and uses css blend modes to show the crossover areas.

### Ideas

It sould be cool to animate it, maybe animate a selection or be able to move it with touch. This seems complecated to get right as the center of the venn diagram is not the center of the circle that encompasses it.
