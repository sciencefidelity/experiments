# Fractions

The challenge: Make circle fractions with css.

Background: A few years ago I made a video using vinyl records with their centers spraypainted into fractions.

### To do 

- Make the circles spin.
- Add sound that trigger as the lines pass a point.
- Add speed controls to remix the sounds.
