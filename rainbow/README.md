# Rainbow

The challenge: Make a rainbow with css.
The solution: Box shadow!

### To do 

- Find a way to make the rainbow reponsive. Setting a font size in vw sort of works but start before the circle shrinks and doesn't pay attention to changes in screen height.
- Animate the clip-path to make the reinbow grow, make a chain of rainbows.
